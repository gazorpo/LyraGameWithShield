# Lyra with Shield

The Lyra project is to provide a bootstrapping game for Unreal Engine.  Lyra is intended to be a living sample that shows how we build scalable games around the engines core technology.

This repo adds a shield to the health so damage is done to the shield first and only excess damage is done to the health. Extra work would be required to show the shield status on the screen. If you want to make the shield recharge, you can use blueprints like in the images here: https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/how-to-auto-recharge-health-shield-after-delay-in-lyra/546606/2?u=gazorpo
